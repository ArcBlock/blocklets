## What are blocklets?

**Blocklets** are reusable building blocks to help developers and community users to build things on [ArcBlock](https://www.arcblock.io) platform. A blocklet serves one and only one purpose, reusability is the core design philosophy of blocklets. Reusability makes it easy to compose multiple blocklets to build a more complex application.

Blocklets comes in many forms, including but not limited to:

- A starter template, from which a developer can bootstrap an dapp already connected to forge-powered blockchain within minutes
- A full-featured dApp, with which a miner or community user can install and get it up and running quickly
- A smart contract, which defines the on-chain pipeline of a business logic and can be deployed to forge-powered chains with one click

## What is blocklet registry?

To help developers to find usable blocklets more easily, all blocklets built by ArcBlock and community developers are listed on [blocklet.arcblock.io](https://blocklet.arcblock.io), which is a website built from [ArcBlock/blocklets](https://github.com/arcblock/blocklets), users can search and view listed blocklets and use the blocklet with just one command, this website is called the blocklet registry.
